-- Resolving cases with multiple candidates

Choose the product with the most detailed match.

Product A has a more detailed match than product B:
- if A's family matches the listing and B's family does not (or is null)
- otherwise, if A's model contains more tokens than B's model
- otherwise, if the sum of the lengths of A's model tokens exceeds that of B

If there is still a tie, we declare no match.
