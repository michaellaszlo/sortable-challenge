-- Resolving cases with multiple candidates

If there are more than three candidates, we declare no match.

Otherwise, we choose the product with the most detailed match.

Product A has a more detailed match than product B...
- if A's family matches the listing and B's family does not (or is null)
- otherwise, if A has more model tokens than B
- otherwise, if the sum of the lengths of A's model tokens exceeds that of B

If there is still a tie, we declare no match.
